I"³<p>Iâ€™m a research masterâ€™s student at the <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/">University of Montreal</a> under the supervision of
 <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xsUkTCEAAAAJ&amp;hl=fr">Prof. Houari Sahraoui</a>, currently working on neural interfaces for artificial neural network.</p>

<p>My life goal is to build and explore all the possibilities of the symbiosis between the brain and AI, in more scientific terms, going toward what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajesh_P._N._Rao"> Rajesh Rao</a> called in his  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11876">long term vision paper</a> a neural-coprocessor ; a co-adapative bidirectional neural interface using AI.</p>

<p>Although this is my main long-term research goal, I am very interested in all fields related to this idea, especially deep learning, reinforcement learning, robotics, brain-computer interface, and computational neuroscience. I have been learning AI during my masterâ€™s degree at the University of Montreal where I took all my courses at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">MILA</a>, and I have been self-studying neuroscience and brain-computer interface since my early bachelor years with university-level textbooks and by reading the literature.</p>

<p>My CV can be found <a href="https://atonkamanda.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_Aton_Kamanda.pdf">here</a>, I regularly update the litterature on AI for BCI <a href="https://github.com/atonkamanda/awesome-ai-brain-computer-interface">here</a>.</p>

<p>Below I detail some of the research directions I am considering working on in the future. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:atonkamanda@hotmail.com">contact me</a> if you are interested in collaborating.</p>

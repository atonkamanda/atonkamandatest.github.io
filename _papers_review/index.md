I'm a research master's student at the <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/">University of Montreal</a> under the supervision of
 <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xsUkTCEAAAAJ&hl=fr">Prof. Houari Sahraoui</a>, currently working on neural interfaces for artificial neural network.


My life goal is to build and explore all the possibilities of the symbiosis between the brain and AI, in more scientific terms, going toward what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajesh_P._N._Rao"> Rajesh Rao</a> called in his  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11876">long term vision paper</a> a neural-coprocessor ; a co-adapative bidirectional neural interface using AI.

Although this is my main long-term research goal, I am very interested in all fields related to this idea, especially deep learning, reinforcement learning, robotics, brain-computer interface, and computational neuroscience. I have been learning AI during my master's degree at the University of Montreal where I took all my courses at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">MILA</a>, and I have been self-studying neuroscience and brain-computer interface since my early bachelor years with university-level textbooks and by reading the literature.


My CV can be found [here](https://atonkamanda.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_Aton_Kamanda.pdf), I regularly update the litterature on AI for BCI [here](https://github.com/atonkamanda/awesome-ai-brain-computer-interface).

Below I detail some of the research directions I am considering working on in the future. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:atonkamanda@hotmail.com) if you are interested in collaborating.
